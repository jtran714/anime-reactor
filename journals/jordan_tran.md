Jess, Cheng, and I decided to scrap our project due to wasted time trying to figure out how to link databases together. Instructor gave us an example project that showed mongo databases linked together. However, he shipped us a broken project.......... Most of the endpoints aren't working. So that is why we decided to scrap our project and redo it using Postgre.. SUPER FRUSTRATING DUDE.

We have our authentication down and it finally worked. However our blockers as of now is trying to link our databases together.

Jess, Cheng, and I got our post to work but we are still trying to figure out how to link our databases together...

Today we are still trying to link up our multiple databases together but still no luck. We are currently researching the topic.

Cheng, Jess, and I started writing out our backend to try to get our respective services to post. So far a lot of progress has been made.

Wrote backend for my favorite service. I feel like I am on the right track but there are still some blockers regarding linking mongoDB together.

Jess, Cheng, and I were figuring out how to set up the project. Our problem was trying to get all containers working. But, nothing always goes as planned because our ghi and mongo express containers aren't running.. However we fixed our ghi containers relatively quickly but when trying to get mongo express container running, we spent all day trying to fix it. After we've exhausted our options, we decided to ask for help. The seirs, Matt and John came through for us and even though Matt and John never touched mongoDB before, they went out of their way to research the problem and instructed us to do trial and error stuff into our yaml file. After a few hours, of tweaking our yaml file, the container finally decided to run.... Thank you Matt and John.. Also huge thanks to Matt for explaining how asynchronous JS works. Literally dumbed it down for me.

Today, I worked on creating issues on our shared project repo and discussed on how points will be allocated per feature. We also discussed which tasks each person will tackle. In the end, I decided to do the favorites service and hopefully I get to do the search function when I am done with my side in the future. Also as a group, we decided to use mongoDB as our database over PostgreSQL because why not....?
