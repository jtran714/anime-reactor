Today, I worked on:

- Allotting points for each issue/stories and generating them in GitLab for MVP #1 and MVP #2.

My team and I discussed how we would implement our databases, and we have agreed to use a foreign key.
After discussing with Andrew, we have decided to proceed with MongoDB. We split up the MVP between all team members,
and I will be working on the login and logout functionality with Tommy.

Today, I learned about the differences between MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
I think that I prefer MongoDB so far! Seems like there's significantly less
syntax to memorize, but we will need to figure out how to make data relational.
