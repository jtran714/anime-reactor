- Frontend Fixes (Logout button token)

Today I recieved help from James to solve an issue I was recieving from my logout button. For some reason the token did not delete itself after I had logged out. JAmes walked me through the logic of what I could do to solve it. We spent about half an hour and when James said that I tried to create another source of truth for the token instead of just leaving the auth as the single source of truth everything just clicked! I was happy that I was able to recieve a walkthrough with what to do as it really helped me understand more of the project, especially the authentication part.

- Unit tests
- Read Me
- Frontend Forms (Account Edit Form)

Today I asked my team to help me complete my unit tests. Alvi primarily helped me with the logic behind the unit tests and how to fix it. We successfully completed the unit tests. I also worked on taking the wireframes form the excalidraw we created so that we can input them in our Read Me. We as a team specifically Alvi and Jess helped me merge into the main branch. We spend a lot of time waiting for the pipeline to complete. After the third attentance token I had an error that my token was not following me when I signed in and edited after merging and deploying. I shared my screen with the team to see what the problem could be. We spent close to an hour trying to figure the cause of the problem so I reached out to a seir to help me with 401 error I was gettign everytime I changed my profile information. We spent about half an hour assessing what the problem could be and Robbie helped me solve the problem with a few tiny changes in the code so I was estatic!

- Frontend Forms(Refactoring)
- Unit Tests

Today I updated my team with my progress, I was able to complete the sign up form to redirect to the features page instead of the login page.  I need to refactor all of the forms I had done since there was a lot of unused code. I communicated with Cheng today about setting up my unit test. I also shared my screen to get help from Jess and Cheng on completing my unit test. 


## January 23rd 

- Frontend Forms (sign up form) 

Today I shared my screen to display what I had done to complete the MVP. After the team assessed what I had done they communicated that I needed to have my sign up form page redirect to the main features page instead of the log in form page. I had trouble understanding what to do at first but I researched and tried a whole bunch of methods. I was able to figure out on the same day! 


## January 22nd, 2023

- Frontend Forms (sign up form) 

Today I was finally able to complete my sign up form! I needed to change a few things in the frontend auth file for it to work so I am extremely relieved that it is complete! I am excited to show my team what I have completed so far. I also figured out a new way to refactor the code which I never knew I could do before! 


## January 21st, 2023 

- Frontend Forms (Account Button, logout message display, redirecting pages to correct paths ) 

Today I focused on connecting all of my parts together. I had completed creating a log out button and allowing it to display when we have signed out. I also had problems redirecting to the correct pages, so I primarily worked on that. 


## January 20th, 2023

- Frontend Forms (sign up form, log out button) 

Today I updated my team with my current progress. I had completed my edit form and edit detail form, but still had problems with my sign-up form. I attempted to solve the problem myself, but then decided to have my team take a look. Jordan primarily helped me with the sign up problem I had, so I tried what he recommended. It did not end up working, but it helped me understand a bit more about wha the problem could be. Today I shared my screen to get assistance on a bug I was getting every single time I logged out. Everyone on my team helped me evaluate what the problem could have been and it worked! The error I received was an incorrect use of hooks and Alvi recommend that I should refactor so that it would not be improper use of the code. I then switched my logout button functioning in the Nav.js, but once I moved it into its own file it worked perfectly fine! 


## January 19th, 2023

- Frontend Forms (account detail form, sign up form, and account edit form) 

Today I updated my team with my current progress and what caught my eye was how Alvi made the homepage, which was stunning. I noticed that this team works extremely hard whether it be assisting each other, working long hours on the projects, and much more. Since Jess was finished with her MVP portion she focused on setting up the deployment which was extremely helpful to everyone else so they could focus on what they needed to be done. Way after class, I spoke to Jess and Jordan to assist with debugging a problem I had in my sign up form and I shared my screen on discord. They were helpful on how they explained what I should try to do. I also completed my account edit form and account detail view form. I needed to change the auth.py in order for my pages to update correctly. 


## January 18th, 2023

- Frontend Forms (account detail form, sign up form, and authentication) 

Today I updated my team with my current position and shared my screen with my team so that they can help me debug and resolve problems that I have been having. I worked on getting my sign up page to work correctly and correcting my detail view form and edit form to communicated correctly. I also had a meeting with Itzel and Andrew that I was not communicating enough. I plan to solve that by updating my team daily with what my current tasks are. I will try and share my code so that I can pair program or seek assistance from my teammates when needed. Since we did not have much time left I wanted to take immediate action.


## January 17th, 2023

- Frontend Forms (account detail form, account edit form, and sign up form) 

After the long weekend coming back was rough. Today I worked on getting my sign up form to work. For some reason my token was not being received by the form, so I continued to dissect what the solution to my problem could be. I had several errors popping up such as 401, 404, and 500. The account detail form and the account edit form still are not working. I am trying many ways to get them to communicate with each other, however it seems that I am able to edit successfully, but the detail view form does not automatically render the corrected account information. I have to log out in order for the detail view page to have the correct information. 


## January 16th, 2023

- Frontend Forms (account detail form, account edit form, sign up form) 

Today is the MLK holiday. I did not spend too much time coding today, but I was able to get my authentication to work. I plan to work on my sign up form next. I also had trouble connecting the account edit from to the account detail view. 


## January 15th, 2023

- Frontend Forms (Login, account edit form, and authentication) 

Today I continued to work on the login form and front end authentication. I was able to get the login form to work, but the authentication part was still difficult for me. I rewatched lectures and learn materials to get a better grasps of things. I decided to get started on the account edit form as well. 


## January 14th, 2023

- Frontend Forms (Login and authentication) 

Today I worked on the login form and the front end authentication, I got several errors, but I was able to get though them. For example I kept receiving a 401 unauthorized in my developers console.


## January 13th, 2023 

- Frontend Forms (Login and authentication) 

Today Jess messaged the group on what task we could focus on during the weekend. Everyone updated each other with what they plan to focus on. I decided to focus on the login form and authentication. 


## January 12th, 2023 

- Frontend Forms and Buttons ( sign-up, login, account edit form, account detail form, log out  and account button, and front end authentication)

Today I had a discussion with my team about how much time it took me to catch up to everyone in terms of setting up the backend, so we decided that I will be taking over all of the frontend portions. The Login page, Sign up page, account edit form, account detail form, logout and account buttons and a dropdown menu of everything.

- Postgres Database ( Understanding and implementation) 

Jess, Jordan, and Cheng primarily worked on the backend Mongo-db material and code and since they were stuck on not being able to link the databases, we as a team decided to switch over to the Postgres database. This made things much easier as we had more material to reference and it made more sense to integrate into our project. 


## January 10th, 2023

-Mongo-db Database (understanding and implementation) 

Today I continued to get my edit account endpoint to work and spent more time trying to understand hoe mongo-db works along with the code associated with it. 


## January 9th, 2023 

-Mongo-db Database (understanding and implementation) 

Today I continued to get my edit account endpoint to work. I spent more time to understand how Mongo-db works and the code associated with it. 


## January 6th, 2023

-Git-lab (Issues and Stories)
-Mongo-db Database (understanding and implementation) 

Today I created my issues and was tasked to complete the account edit endpoint in Mongo-db. Since I was out the last two days and my teammates work late at night I asked my team what was completed or discussed already. I also spent most of my time understanding how Mongo-db worked since I had more knowledge on Postgres since there was more documentation/material for it. 


## January 5th, 2023 

Today I received a message from PG&E that my power will be turned back at 1:37pm. This was not the case as the time kept pushing out further and further. I ended up not having power until 8:00pm. I attempted to leave my house to go to Starbucks or anywhere with internet, but due to my garage being attached to the apartment with no other entry but the garage I was stuck here until Maintence or PG&E could fix the problem. I communicated to the instructors and my team about this. 


## January 4th, 2023

- Wireframes (Creation on Excalidraw)
- Minimum Viable Product (Points and teammate distribution) 

Today we as a team discussed how we should set up our wireframes and MVP. I created a skeleton of what the page could have looked like. There was a big storm happening to the Bay Area which affected my location as well. My power turned off around 3:30pm but was turned back on immediately. Soon after at 4:00pm my power shut off again, but did not turn back on. I had communicated with my team and the instructors about my situation through slack.
